# Studio on Walnut - CIS5500 Project That Helps You Write Your Movie Script

Have you thought about making your own movie? Well, we can’t give you the money to do it, but we have a platform for you to customize it! At Studio on Walnut, you can find actor’s profiles, movie descriptions, and everything movie-related to design your own movie. Sci-fi? We have effect samples for you to show. A love story for Romeo and Juliet? You will find your best choices for them! Whatever your fantasy, whatever you dream about, you can make it here. 

More technically, the project will have a database that stores various kinds of information about movies, like actors’ name, age, and played characters, or their box office and producers. The frontend will have two parts. First, there will be a website where users can view and retrieve information about a movie. Information like movies with top ratings and actors’ profiles will be shown for users to consider. The other part of the platform is the movie designing page. Users will be able to design their own movies by selecting actors, finding similar movies, writing their scripts, and uploading any photos and videos to show the visual effects they like.
